This is a tagging/bookmarking program. Similar to the
dmenu-integration for ~pass~, ~tagr~ can access its tags using dmenu.
It stores and retrieves tags from a single file stored locally in
~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME~, by defaults in ~$HOME/.config/tagr/~.


* Install

Install ~tagr~ using
#+begin_src shell
sudo make install
#+end_src
This will install the script to ~/usr/local/bin/~ which should already
be in your PATH, and the list of tags in ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tags~.

Alternatively you can run
#+begin_src shell
PREFIX=/path/of/your/choice make install
#+end_src
which might need sudo priviliges depending on your choice.
Don't forget to add the chosen prefix to your PATH.

To uninstall ~tagr~ (from any location), simply run
#+begin_src shell
sudo make uninstall
#+end_src
